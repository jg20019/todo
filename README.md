# TODO 

A simple todo list. 

This project was built to learn about Vue while also scratching my own itch. 
During the work day, I tend to make todo lists in notepad. Under each todo,
I add notes about what I have done or what I am thinking about. I try to keep
todos ordered by priority so that the most important things are at the top. And
lastly, I create multiple lists for different aspects of life. For example, 
I currently have lists for work, chores, and practice. This tool should make
the following things easy.

- Make and name multiple lists
- Show / Hide Todos by completion
- Add notes to a todo
- Reorder items between todos
- Move items between lists
